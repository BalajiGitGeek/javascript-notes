1. What happens when we print the assinged variable/function before the value/function is assigned?
we can able to access the normal functions but the variable will be undefined and it is called as hoisting.

2. Is undefined and not-defined is same?
No. If we din't reserve memory for the variable, then it will throw a error that referrence error: not-defined. But in the case of undefined, the memory will be reserved.

3. what it we use arrow function or assigned a function to the variable in the function definition?
It will throw a error that it is not a function. It behaves as a variable.

4. What is hoisting?
Access the variable before the initialization. It is possible only in the javascript.
